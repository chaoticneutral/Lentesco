Haikus are a fun intro.
I have seen this world
I have seen its fickle ways
It can't surprise me

Rocking...back and forth...
The boat listed to starboard as the crew stumbled, trying to keep their balance.  Sebastian desparately spun the wheel, hoping to stabilize the rudder and level out the ship. The goods they carried were tightly strapped down, but fragile enough that their profits could depend on his ability to keep the ship even.  Being the helmsman for a merchant ship bore with it certain benefits, but if something were to go wrong, he was the most obvious target for blame.  
The day had started out smoothly--clear skies, a light tailwind, and what seemed like a golden opportunity to bring their merchandise in to port a day or two ahead of schedule and gain a few extra hours of leave.  Even when the sun was blocked out by dark clouds that drifted around the sky like moths hovering around a flame, drawn to its light but repelled by its heat, the opportunity to make the most of the mild weather that remained seemed too good. 
Once the sun started to go down, most of the crew went below decks for evening mess and sleep, leaving Sebastian and the night watch in charge of the ship.  It was routine, repeated night after night, and the night crew had established themselves to be as even-headed a group as had ever piloted a ship, each one proficient in their duties.  Sebastian knew something as amiss when the boat lurched and Charles, in the crow's nest, nearly lost his footing.  Sebastian had seen Charles man his post during gales, hurricanes, ship-to-ship combat and every other situation a merchant ship could find itself in, and not once had he shown any sign of difficulty in keeping his balance.  Somewhat unnerved, Sebastian gently rotated the wheel to reassure himself that the lurch was simply a moment of high spirits by the Lady of the Ocean--he had seen stranger things happen when the gods decided to play games.  His peace of mind was shattered when the rudder resisted him, as if the water had started to solidify around the ship.

NOTE:

I propose to reuse the "rocking...back and forth..." as an intro to when he's on the horse, gradually waking up, rocking back and forth, flashing back to the ship thing and then "what the fuck i'm on a horse what is this shit"
